# pygame-invaders
It began in a galaxy far far away...actually it didn't really but started here on Earth.

One morning an multiple alien ships were suddenly detected over towns and cities worldwide. Whilst the various defence systems world wide were able to handle this first wave, they started to slowly be eradicated by the aliens and a new generation were required to step up but they needed to be trained.

This is where you come onboard and help to create a simple training simulator to defend the planet.
